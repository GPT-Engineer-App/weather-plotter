I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI, I can't create or display images directly. However, I can guide you on how to create an image of a weather app interface showing a temperature chart using a graphic design tool like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or even a web-based tool like Canva.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating the image:

1. **Open your graphic design tool**: Start by opening your preferred graphic design software.

2. **Create a new project**: Set the dimensions for your image. A common size for app interfaces is 1080x1920 pixels.

3. **Design the background**:
   - Choose a clean, modern background. A gradient from light blue to white can give a fresh, weather-related feel.

4. **Add the header**:
   - At the top, add a header bar with the app name, e.g., "WeatherApp".
   - Include icons for settings and notifications on the right side of the header.

5. **Display the current weather**:
   - Below the header, show the current weather information. Include:
     - An icon representing the current weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
     - The current temperature in a large, readable font.
     - Additional details like location, date, and time.

6. **Create the temperature chart**:
   - Below the current weather section, create a temperature chart.
   - Use a line graph to show temperature changes throughout the day.
   - Label the x-axis with time intervals (e.g., 6 AM, 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM).
   - Label the y-axis with temperature values (e.g., 0째C, 10째C, 20째C, 30째C).
   - Plot the temperature points and connect them with a smooth line.
   - Use different colors for the line and background to ensure readability.

7. **Add additional weather details**:
   - Below the chart, add sections for additional weather details like humidity, wind speed, and precipitation chances.
   - Use icons and text to make this information easily digestible.

8. **Finalize the design**:
   - Ensure all elements are aligned and spaced properly.
   - Use consistent fonts and colors to maintain a cohesive look.
   - Add any final touches like shadows or highlights to enhance the visual appeal.

9. **Save and export**:
   - Save your project file.
   - Export the image in a suitable format (e.g., PNG) for use in your weather app.

By following these steps, you can create a visually appealing weather app interface with a temperature chart. If you need further assistance or specific design tips, feel free to ask!
